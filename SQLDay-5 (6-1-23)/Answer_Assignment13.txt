Assume a hypothetical company that manages multiple automobile dealerships throughout INDIA.

Following are the data requirements of our company :

* A "car" is described by a vehicle identification number (VIN), make (e.g., Toyota), model (e.g., Prius), year, mileage, and two prices: the asking price (how much the dealership would like to sell the car for) and the invoice price (how much the dealership paid for the car). This information is maintained for every car currently in any dealership's inventory, and also for every car that has ever been sold by one of the dealerships. 

* A dealership is a single location where the company sells cars. The company manages many dealerships, each one being described by a unique dealership ID, a name (e.g., Honda Sales, Yamaha World, Concept Hyundai etc.), street address, city, and state.

* The company employs a number of salespeople. Each salesperson is assigned a unique salesperson ID. 

* Salespeople work at one or more dealerships each month, and are paid a monthly base salary at each, regardless of how many cars they sell. Additionally, they are paid a commission on each car they sell. 

* Information is maintained about all salespeople who ever worked for any dealership.

* The following information is kept about each customer : ID, name, street address, city, and state.

* Salespeople are arranged in a strict hierarchy, with each salesperson reporting to a "managing salesperson."

* It is necessary to keep track of the inventory of cars currently available at each dealership. Of course, a particular car can only be in the inventory of one dealership at any given time.

* A long-term record of all car sales is maintained. For each sale, the company tracks which car was bought, which customer bought it, which salesperson sold it, which dealership it was sold by, at which price it was sold for, and on which date it was sold.
